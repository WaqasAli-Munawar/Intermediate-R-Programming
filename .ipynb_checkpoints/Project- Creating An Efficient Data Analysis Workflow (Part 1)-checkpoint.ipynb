Answering these questions saves our time and effort later.\n",

    "### Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are more familiar with the data itself, now we can get into the more specific details of data analysis. A large part of a data analyst's job is to take a raw dataset and turn it into a form that we can use for analysis. Many times, we will not be able to just take a dataset and start analyzing it. It's good practice to examine the data beforehand and make note of any changes we need to make for it. This process has many names, but for future reference, we'll call it **data cleaning** or **data processing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue we will contend with is the issue of missing data. Missing data is annoying because there's nothing we can really do with it. We can't perform any analysis or calculations with missing data. In R, missing data is typically shown with `NA`, which stands for **\"not available\"**. Some other datasets may convey missingness in a different way, but `NA` is the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that we can deal with missing data: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove any rows or columns that have missing data (typically, rows) or \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill in the missing data in an informed, discipline way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This second way is known as **imputation**, and it's outside of the scope of what we've learned so far. For now, we'll take first approach with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Working With Tibbles that we can use a combination of the [`filter()` function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) and the [`is.na()` function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/NA.html) to remove rows that have missing data. `is.na()` will return `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on if a value is `NA` or not. This makes it an excellent candidate to `filter()` on."

    "\n",
    "The next thing that we need to work on is the `state` column. We may have noticed that the labeling for each state is inconsistent. For example, California is written as both \"California\" and \"CA\". Both \"California\" and \"CA\" refer to the same place in the United States, so we should try to clean this up. We need to choose one of the ways to refer to the state, and stick to that convention. Making labels/strings more consistent in the data will make things easier to analyze later on.\n",

We are acting as an analyst trying to figure out which books are the most profitable for the company. The initial data wasn't in a form that was ready for analysis, so we needed to do this cleaning to prepare it. A lot of analysts starting their first jobs believe that the analysis part of their job will be the bulk of their work. To the contrary, a lot of our work will focus on data cleaning itself, while by comparison the data analysis might only take a few lines.\n",

One way to define \"most profitable\" might be to just choose the book that's purchased the most. Another way to define it would be to see how much money each book generates overall."

Take some time to organize our notes into a small report. This report doesn't need to be a long essay! It only need to communicate the answer to our company's question: \"What's our most profitable book?\" There are several sub-questions that might need to be answered along with this question like, \"How do we know it's the most profitable?\" or \"How did we calculate our measure for profitability\"? Our report is just trying to demonstrate that we have an answer and that we gave some thought on how to get to this answer.\n",
